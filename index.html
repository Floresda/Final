    <h2 style="background-color: #A60D0D; width: 120px; padding-left: 5px;">Who I am</h2>
    <img src="Me.jpg" alt="Smiling Picture of me" style="width: 250px; height: 300px;float: right;">
    <p style="margin-top: 50px;">I'm 21 years young and pursuing a bachelors degree in computer graphics technology.
    I've had previous goals of working for a big business like google, apple, or tesla. In 5 year
    I see myself working as a full time employee at a graphic design company or business that'll kick
    start my career as a graphic designer.</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 25px;">Why I chose to come to IUPUI and Indianapolis was because I wanted to experience what it was like
    to live in the city and give me an experience outside of living in the country where nothing goes on.
    My family resides in a small town called Ligonier up in NorthEastern Indiana, I have 3 sister and no brothers, and
    I have a big family that lives in the town.</p>
    <h2 style="background-color: #A60D0D; width:200px; padding-left:5px; margin-top:75px;">Physical Activity</h2>
    <img src="Gym.jpg" alt="Gym Rack" class="gym">
    <p>Regularly during the school year I aim to hit the gym about 3 to 4 times based on how busy I am with school and work.
    I've started hitting the gym for my health due to the fact I was being very inactive and huge motivator was my cousin Michael
    who encouraged me to go out to the gym with him and told me to stop being lazy. With his help over the past year I gained about
    40lbs of mass and never felt better.</p>

        <p>Above are images I've used to post on my social media as well as using them for my final. My favorite overall picture I've worked on is the spiderman poster because I used it for a final and recieve a really good grade. It took about 10 hours to create, but it well worth it in the end. You can click on each photo to get an even closer look.</p>
